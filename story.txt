This was no ordinary day for Planty the Potted Plant. Has he approached the public bullitan board to see the daily news, something caught his eye. "Holy canoli!"
Planty the Potted Plant gasped, "They're giving away manure for FREE at the greenhouse?"
Planty the Potted Plant, much like a Veggie tales character,
hopped over from the town garden to the Green House, the seediest place in town.

When he hopped over the fence, he tripped and all of his potting soil fell on the ground.
Quickly running out of nutrients, he fell into a coma and never woke up again. This made his son, 
Planterson, very sad. To avenge his father, he vowed to destroy all fences in
greenhouses.

Planterson founded the Anti-Greenhouse Fence Army. It only took days for word of his cause to spread
across the country. Greenhouses were vandalized and razed. The agricultural sector was in shambles.
Planterson's group was quickly crumbling as the sheer momentum outpaced careful planning and
coordination.
